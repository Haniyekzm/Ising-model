“Calculation of the system’s magnetization and energy using the Ising model, and
plotting the results as a function of time and as a function of temperature."
# Magnetization and Energy Calculation using the Ising Model

## Overview
This project calculates the **magnetization and energy** of a spin system using the
**Ising model**.
The results are plotted in two cases:
- As a function of time
- As a function of temperature

## Features
- Simulation of spin systems with the Ising model
- Calculation of total magnetization
- Calculation of system energy during the simulation
- Plotting magnetization and energy vs. time
- Plotting magnetization and energy vs. temperature
